		<h3>Our Investment &amp; Development Services:</h3>
		<p>In additional to the Real Estate Broker services provided by Brandeburg Development Group, Inc., Investors can consider a host of development services available through independent professionals working closely with John Brandeburg.</p>
		<p>Investors are always directed to independent authority for making decisions….don’t just rely on a real estate broker who is there to sell you property. When working with Brandeburg Development Group, investors will be introduced to individuals in county or city government, or planning or legal professionals involved in zoning, or annexation, or lenders.</p>
		<p>Also, if you decide to acquire a property from Brandeburg Development Group, Inc., you may consider a construction project or development with John Brandeburg as a partner and re-listing the new development or leasing it through that group.</p>
		<p>If you are an investor desiring to do more than just buy property for resale, then you will want to call John Brandeburg for a confidential Strategic Planning Session to review the many options that may be available.</p>
		<p>Brandeburg Development Group has been opened to provide growth and building that will benefit the overall community. This is done primarily through relationship building. Call and schedule a face-to-face meeting to learn more.</p>
