		<h1>Where To Start</h1>
		<h4>Here is some of John Brandeburg's Advice</h4>
		<p>If you want to buy a building, or buy vacant land, or invest in real estate, or you are a doctor looking to build or lease….it all starts with a face-to-face meeting at the Citizens Boulevard offices of Brandeburg Development Group, Inc.</p>
		<p>There you will find technology and resources including; maps, geological data, source information, pictures and a quantity of information on Lake and Sumter County commercial and industrial and development real estate that is not easily found elsewhere. Please call us at (352) 435-0500 for a no charge initial Strategic Planning Session to get started.</p>
		<p>“Most people call me after they have started to search for property. They rarely did any formal planning as a first step. This is a mistake that can seriously limit the search process for Buying or the marketing process for Selling a property. I want to help you get the best value out of the Buying or Selling of Commercial or Industrial or Development potential real estate.”</p>
